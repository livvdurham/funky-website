  <h1>About Me:</h1>
<p class="big"> I am a rising junior in high school from the Greater New York City Area. I am a member of Jersey City's City Wide Student Council as well as the Student Council President of my school. I have a huge interest in the sciences and am planning to study Biological Anthropology and PreMed in college. When I am not busy with extracurriculars such as Student Council, track, and cheerleading, I enjoy reading books. This summer I am taking part in the <strong>Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program</strong>. </p>
